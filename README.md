# Chat Logger

There is an open chat.

When a person enters the chat, the following message is displayed.
"[Nickname] came in."

When a person leaves the chat, the following message is displayed.
"[Nickname] has left."

There are two ways to change nicknames in a chat:
After leaving the chat, you can re-enter with the new nickname.
Change nickname in a chat.

When changing a nickname, the nickname of the previous messages displayed in the chat is also changed.

For example, if a person uses the nickname "Spiderman" and "Ironman" in the chat in order, the following message is displayed in the chat.

"Spiderman came in." "Ironman came in."

When "Spiderman" leaves the room, the following message is left.
"Spiderman came in." "Ironman came in." "Spiderman has left."

When Spiderman comes back in again with the new nickname, Ironman , the previous messages are changed to Ironman as follows.

"Ironman came in." "Ironman came in." "Ironman has left." "Ironman came in."

Since the chat allows duplicate nicknames, there are currently two people in the chat who use the nickname, Ironman. Now, when Ironman (the second person) changes his nickname to Hulk, the chat message is changed as follows.

"Ironman came in." "Hulk came in." "Ironman has left." "Ironman came in."
